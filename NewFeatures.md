# New Features 

### New features to add to existing functionality
Got it! Here's a concise summary based on your plans:

1. Completed initial stages of dating app post-registration, focusing on personal, professional, and registration data collection. Implemented profile picture and short reel uploads, but need a solution for handling unfinished submissions to prevent unused file storage.

2. Plan to display previously uploaded profile pictures on revisit and propose confirming file deletion before allowing new uploads to replace existing ones.

3. Identified potential security issue with separate file delete and upload routes. Propose integrating delete functionality into upload process to mitigate unauthorized file deletion risks.

4. Considering implementing checks to restrict profile picture and short reel uploads until the personal section is complete. Also planning middleware to manage file uploads and delete unused files from storage.
